Turning data into decisions—that’s what drives me. As an aspiring Data Analyst,
I combine tools like Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI to explore, analyze, and communicate data in meaningful ways.

I enjoy taking on challenging datasets, building interactive dashboards, and telling the story behind the numbers. Always learning, always building.
